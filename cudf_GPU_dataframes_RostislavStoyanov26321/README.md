# cuDF - GPU dataframes

Slides and notebooks for the cuDF presentation, presented in "Knowledge Discovery in Data course".

**Note: Notebooks are designed to be run in Colab, if running locally ensure you have the necessary libraries(cudf, pandas) installed and don't run the section that installs libraries.**
